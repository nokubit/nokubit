Nokubit chain: fork from bitcoin-0.16.3
=====================================

The token economy industry has been rising and developing in the last 3 years, first on the Ethereum Blockchain and now on other platforms such as EOS.

Even Bitcoin Blockchain supports tokens, thanks to protocols running on top of it (including Omni and Counterparty). However, due to scalability issues on-chain, lack of flexibility and poor marketing, Bitcoin remained on the sidelines of the Token Economy industry.

Furthermore, the market has progressed around the ICO market and functional tokens; On the other hand, traditional securities such as bonds and derivatives, which have the most relevant role in finance, have been completely left aside.

Nokubit was designed to further enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem by opening its gates to the token economy. Not just to stable coins and utility tokens; but to all of the securities that have remained excluded from the tokenization process until now.
With these objectives in our mind, we are creating a Bitcoin sidechain dedicated to such assets (derivatives, shares, bonds ecc..).

We are aware that it is very difficult to acquire quotas in an industry where network effect has such a relevance; for this reason, Nokubit provides protocol-based incentives directed at those who create tokenized assets (or move their existing assets on it).

In particular, each emitter will be receiving a percentage of the transaction fees collected through its token.

In order to get more shares in the securities market, we will be providing additional incentives. When it comes to securities issued inside the legal frame of a country, if the laws are compliant with Bitcoin's principles and grant legal status to tokenized securities, that country will earn a percentage of the transaction fees generated by those securities

We are also developing additional tools to support the main financial operations that take place in traditional markets (dividends, splits, etc).

Moreover, Nokubit project is driven by ideological reasons first rather than commercial ones. Our primary goal is to enrich and reinforce the Bitcoin ecosystem.

To prove our vision we want to donate a substantial cut of the profits in support of Bitcoin Core and in the development of the Bitcoin code. In addition, Nokubit will donate part of its earnings to support the adoption of the lightning network through marketing initiatives.

For these reasons, we are confident about receiving a warm support from the Bitcoin community. The alpha version of the software will be released shortly on GitHub to receive reviews and begin with the testing process. In the upcoming weeks, we will release articles that will focus on the various specific aspects of Nokubit clarifying the details and design choices.

What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoin.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #bitcoin-core-dev.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).
